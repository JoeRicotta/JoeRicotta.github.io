  title={Stability of Action and Kinesthetic Perception in Parkinson's Disease},
  author={Ricotta, J., Latash, M.L.},
  abstract={We present a review of action and perception stability within the theoretical framework based on the idea of control with spatial referent coordinates for the effectors at a number of hierarchical levels. Stability of salient variables is ensured by synergies, neurophysiological structures that act in multi-dimensional spaces of elemental variables and limit variance to the uncontrolled manifold during action and iso-perceptual manifold during perception. Patients with Parkinson's disease show impaired synergic control reflected in poor stability (low synergy indices) and poor agility (low indices of anticipatory synergy adjustments prior to planned quick actions). They also show impaired perception across modalities, including kinesthetic perception. We suggest that poor stability at the level of referent coordinates can be the dominant factor leading to poor stability of percepts.},

  title={Perturbation-induced fast drifts in finger enslaving},
  author={Ricotta J., Cuadra C., Evans J.S., Latash M.L.},
  abstract={We explored changes in finger forces and in an index of unintentional finger force production (enslaving) under a variety of visual feedback conditions and positional finger perturbations. In particular, we tested a hypothesis that enslaving would show a consistent increase with time at characteristic times of about 1-2 s. Young healthy subjects performed accurate force production tasks under visual feedback on the total force of the instructed fingers (index and ring) or enslaved fingers (middle and little). Finger feedback was covertly alternated between master and enslaved fingers in a random fashion. The feedback could be presented over the first 5 s of the trial only or over the whole trial duration (21 s). After 5 s, the fingers were lifted by 1 cm, and after 15 s, the fingers were lowered to the initial position. The force of the instructed fingers drifted toward lower magnitudes in all conditions except the one with continuous feedback on that force. The force of enslaved fingers showed variable behavior across conditions. In all conditions, the index of enslaving showed a consistent increase with the time constant varying between 1 and 3 s. We interpret the results as pointing at the spread of excitation to enslaved fingers (possibly, in the cortical M1 areas). The relatively fast changes in enslaving under positional finger perturbations suggest that quick changes of the input into M1 from pre-M1 areas can accelerate the hypothesized spread of cortical excitation.},

  title={What do people match when they try to match force? Analysis at the level of hypothetical control variables},
  author={Abolins V., Cuadra C., Ricotta J., Latash M.L.},
  abstract={We used the theory of control with spatial referent coordinates (RC) to explore how young, healthy persons modify finger pressing force and match forces between the two hands. Three specific hypotheses were tested related to patterns of RC and apparent stiffness (defined as the slope of force-coordinate relation) used in the presence of visual feedback on the force and in its absence. The subjects used the right hand to produce accurate force under visual feedback; further the force could be increased or decreased, intentionally or unintentionally (induced by controlled lifting or lowering of the fingertips). The left hand was used to match force without visual feedback before and after the force change; the match hand consistently underestimated the actual force change in the task hand. The "inverse piano" device was used to compute RC and apparent stiffness. We found very high coefficients of determination for the inter-trial hyperbolic regressions between RC and apparent stiffness in the presence of visual feedback; the coefficients of determination dropped significantly without visual feedback. There were consistent preferred sharing patterns in the space of RC and apparent stiffness between the task and match hands across subjects. In contrast, there was much less consistency between the task and match hands in the magnitudes of RC and apparent stiffness observed in individual trials. Compared to the task hand, the match hand showed consistently lower magnitudes of apparent stiffness and, correspondingly, larger absolute magnitudes of RC. Involuntary force changes produced by lifting and lowering the force sensors led to significantly lower force changes compared to what could be expected based on the computed values of apparent stiffness and sensor movement amplitude. The results confirm the importance of visual feedback for stabilization of force in the space of hypothetical control variables. They suggest the existence of personal traits reflected in preferred ranges of RC and apparent stiffness across the two hands. They also show that subjects react to external perturbations, even when instructed "not to interfere": Such perturbations cause unintentional and unperceived drifts in both RC and apparent stiffness.},
