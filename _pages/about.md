I'm a motor neuroscientist in training at the Motor Control Lab @ PSU. Presently, I'm enrolled as a dual-title PhD trainee in Kinesiology and Clinical and Translational Sciences and am graciuosly supported as an NIH-TL1 Fellow through the Clinical and Translational Science Institute at PSU. I am a recipient of a doctorate in Physical Therapy and maintain my practice as a board certified specialist in orthopedics.

My work explores the implications of a hierarchically organized neuromotor system on features of stability in both neurotypical persons and persons with neuropathology. Insight into the physical and neural mechanimsms behind movement stability promises to sharpen our knowledge of structure/function relationships in the central nervous system and offers neurologically-meaningful metrics of movement in clinical settings. For example, [metrics of movement may help to diagnose Parkinson's disease (PD) before the onset of clincally observable motor symptoms](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4504804/). 

I am currently investigating how stability in i.) kinesthetic, and ii.) motor unit spaces may differ between persons with and without PD. To do so, I draw from a large pool of theory, including [the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20944446/), [the iso-perceptual manifold hypothesis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29277305/), [equilibrium point hypothesis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19227529/), and [control with referent configuration](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20702893/). Also of interest are the statistical properties of the metrics offered by each of the aforementioned, including the quantification of uncertainty around metrics of stability offered by these theories.
